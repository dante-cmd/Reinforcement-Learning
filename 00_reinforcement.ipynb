    "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a **heuristic search algorithm** for decision-making in environments with large or infinite state spaces, particularly effective in **games with perfect information** (like Go, Chess, Hex) and increasingly used in imperfect information games and general planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Reinforcement Learning (RL), planning problems refer to cases where the model of the environment is known — i.e., you know the transition probabilities $𝑃(𝑠′∣𝑠,𝑎)P(s′∣s,a)$ and the reward function $𝑅(𝑠,𝑎)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of exhaustively exploring the entire game tree (which is infeasible for complex games), MCTS **selectively builds a search tree** by:\n",
    "1. **Randomly simulating** playouts from the current state\n",
    "2. **Gradually focusing** on the most promising branches using statistical estimates\n",
    "3. **Balancing exploration vs. exploitation** using the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** principle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Four Phases of MCTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS operates in iterative cycles, each consisting of four phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection**\n",
    "- Start from the root node (current game state)\n",
    "- Traverse down the tree by selecting child nodes using a **tree policy** (typically UCB1)\n",
    "- Continue until reaching a **leaf node** (a node that hasn't been fully expanded)\n",
    "\n",
    "**UCB1 Formula** (for maximizing player):\n",
    "```\n",
    "UCB1(node) = Q(node)/N(node) + c * √(ln(N(parent)) / N(node))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `Q(node)`: Total reward from simulations through this node\n",
    "- `N(node)`: Number of visits to this node\n",
    "- `c`: Exploration parameter (typically √2 for games)\n",
    "- The first term = **exploitation** (average win rate)\n",
    "- The second term = **exploration** (uncertainty bonus)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansion**\n",
    "- If the leaf node represents a **non-terminal state**, add one or more child nodes (legal moves) to the tree\n",
    "- Select one of the newly added children for simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulation (Rollout)**\n",
    "- From the selected node, perform a **random playout** to a terminal state\n",
    "- Use a **default policy** (often completely random moves)\n",
    "- Record the outcome (win/loss/draw or reward value)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backpropagation**\n",
    "- Propagate the simulation result back up the tree to the root\n",
    "- Update statistics for all nodes along the path:\n",
    "  - Increment visit count `N(node)`\n",
    "  - Add simulation result to total reward `Q(node)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asymmetric Tree Growth**\n",
    "- Unlike minimax, MCTS doesn't explore all branches equally\n",
    "- Focuses computational resources on **promising lines of play**\n",
    "- Tree grows deeper in critical variations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anytime Algorithm**\n",
    "- Can be stopped at any time and return the best move found so far\n",
    "- Quality of solution improves with more computation time\n",
    "- Perfect for real-time decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Domain Knowledge Required** (in basic form)\n",
    "- Only needs:\n",
    "  - Game rules (to generate legal moves)\n",
    "  - Terminal state detection\n",
    "  - Outcome evaluation\n",
    "- However, **domain-specific enhancements** significantly improve performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence Properties**\n",
    "- **Theoretical guarantee**: With infinite simulations, MCTS converges to the optimal move\n",
